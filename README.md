# proceduralSpider2D
A small project involving a 2D procedurally animated creature in Unity 6.
The creatre is a 2 legged spider that can crawl on surfaces and even climb walls. 
It also has an eye that follows the mouse and a sleeping animation if left idle for too long.
I recommend watching this video first to see how it works and for more information.
